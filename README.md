For example you can hire a person to clean your drivethrough. Through the app/website you can hire them. Check how far they are from you and their availability. The price of their serivce and see ratings from other people who have used this persons service. Also the map feature is a work in progress, it will moslty be used to show a general area where the service will be cheaper because it is closer to the location of the service provider ot it might be scrateched as an idea.
