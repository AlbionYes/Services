# Project Details
# Project Title: [Services]
# Problem Statement:
In day to day life people need to get certain jobs done, chores like cleaning the house, babysiting, cutting the grass, tutoring for their child, like piano lessons and other needs that they may have. These tasks become a nuisance, and hinder the life of the people effected by them. Thus people may look into hiring a babysitter to watch their kid, a maid to clean the house and teachers for their kids. But sometimes it may not be that easy to find the people for these jobs. Maybe your friend does or does not know a babysitter, but even if yes can you trust her? Do you know where to find a good cleaning lady for your house? Its a chore on its own trying to look for the right people. These are some of the problems that we can solve.
# Problem Solution
This is where "Services" comes in, simply create a profile, fill in the requirements and start hiring people to do these jobs for you. People can apply for a position and if that person fits the criteria he can will be eligebile to work. A multitude of people can both apply to work and surf the site to find people they need. Just like in the case of fiver. Through a rating system that shows reviews for the corresponding workers and evaluates them. You can find people that fit the criteria that u need and hire them for a price and clear yourself of the daily chores that trouble you.
